# Clash-Royale-Stats-Generator
This was a challenge project i did by myself as a requirement for a course in udemy (The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp by Dr.Angela Yu). To install packages used in this project install the npm packages express, ejs, axios, and body-parser by using the command npm install in the terminal. You can also install nodemon package to run this file easily or you can just use node js.
